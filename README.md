# Track My Run

### How It Works
Put in location and timeframe in Google Maps, the amount of miles you want to run, and your average time per mile. The app will calculate the total run time and display the weather in chunks equal to the total run time within the predetermined timeframe.

(ex. I want to run between 5:00am - 7:00am. I want to run 4 miles at an average pace of 10 minutes/mile. The total run time will be 40 minutes, so the app will display the weather in 40 minute chunks between 5:00am - 7:00am.)
